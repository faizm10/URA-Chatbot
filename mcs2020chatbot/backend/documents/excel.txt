Overview


This course includes Excel assignments to assist you in developing essential Excel skills as one of the important course outcomes. While you can get help and assistance from any source in learning the technical aspects, the final work should be solely done by yourself. 


Purpose    


Excel assignments will give you hands-on experience to learn new skills. These skills help along with problem-solving strategies to assist in formulating, analyzing, and developing recommendations for business problems. 


Instructions


You will see an Excel Assignment section in each of the following units: 




 Unit 02 


 Unit 04 


 Unit 07 


 Unit 09 


 Unit 11 






In each assignment you will be given a unique dataset file, and step-by-step instructions to analyze the dataset, then based on your results, answer questions. Excel assignments are conducted through MyLab in assignments sections. For each assignment, you download a student specific data file and follow step-by-step assignment instructions to analyze data on the downloaded file and submit the final saved file to MyLab for grading. 


Grading Expectations 


Grading of these assignments is automated, and you will receive immediate feedback on your work. Note that you may submit the assignment *as many times as you’d like* to get the perfect grade! Our interest is in you learning the material, not memorizing it. Thus, it is important that you work on the student specific data file generated for your ID and follow step-by-step assignment instructions to analyze data on the downloaded file. You will have as many attempts as you need to make better decisions based on the feedback you receive until you achieve a satisfactory grade.
