Overview
There are six online quizzes that test your comprehension of the content covered in this course. Each quiz covers content from the course, including unit content and textbook readings. The quizzes will cover the learning material from their corresponding unit assigned for the week. They are great practice for the final exam, which will be of similar format.  

The quizzes are an individual assessment and should be written without the assistance of your classmates, but feel free to keep your course notes or readings available. You will need to study in advance, however, as you won’t have enough time on the quiz to “look up” the answer each time in your notes.

Purpose
Each quiz is designed to assess and measure the knowledge you gain from studying the content from specific units. Preparing for each quiz will help you to identify and explain the major concepts and theories covered in the course. Completing each quiz will let you know if you have achieved a course-level learning outcome.

Instructions
Each quiz is comprised of multiple-choice questions. You have one attempt and 30 minutes to complete each quiz.  

To access the weekly quizzes, go to CourseLink and select Quizzes in the Tools tab on the Navbar.

Grading Expectations
Each quiz will be automatically graded. Questions are not released from quizzes. If you’d like to review a grade, please contact the TA to book a meeting. Practice quizzes will be released before the final exam so that you are able to review/practice.
