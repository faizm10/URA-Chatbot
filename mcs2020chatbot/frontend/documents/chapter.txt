Weight: 12% (best 4 of 5) or 3 % each
Submission: via the Simulation Assignments section in MyLab
Due: Weeks 1, 3, 6, 8, 10
Note: Refer to the Outline for the exact due dates

Overview
There are five online interactive simulation assignments, one in each part of the course. You will be taking a managerial role to make decisions and see the following consequences. The dynamic structure of the assignment will let you explore and understand the importance of issues discussed in the course.

Purpose
The purpose of the simulation assignments is to put you in the driver seat of learning by stepping outside of your role as a learner and inhabit another role to learn. Such experiential learning will help you to put the theory you have learnt into practice, in a safe real-world environment, with the goal of cementing your understanding of key core concepts.

Instructions
You will see a Simulation Assignment section in each of the following units:

Unit 01 
Unit 03 
Unit 06 
Unit 08 
Unit 10
Simulation assignments are conducted through MyLab in assignments sections. For each assignment, you roleplay in an interactive scenario based on the course material and choose the best alternative at some decision points and deal with the following consequences.

Grading Expectations
Grading of these assignments is automated, and you will receive immediate feedback on your work. You will have as many attempts as you need to make better decisions based on the feedback you receive until you achieve a satisfactory grade. The lowest of your five grades will be dropped.
