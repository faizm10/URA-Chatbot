Overview
Students will be invited to participate in research studies conducted by faculty or graduate students at the Lang School of Business.  If you cannot find a study, you may complete the "research journal alternative" option (see Courselink newsfeed and Content > Research Journal Alternative for more details).  All questions about SONA should be directed to the SONA administrator (rraso@uoguelph.ca) or the TA.

The Purpose
The purpose of the research component is to create awareness of research in the field of marketing, including how data might be collected.

Instructions
Announcements will be made on CourseLink for students to register for a study. Each student is required to participate in 2 half-hour studies or 1 one-hour study (2 SONA credits in total). Students are encouraged to register for a study as early as possible in the term as there is no certainty for how many studies will be available in any term. If you do not participate in a study, you will receive 0 for this assessment.

Grading Expectations
Students will receive 2% for completion of research study as per the instructions. Credits will be transferred from SONA to the instructor at the end of Week 12.
