# Backend Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed steps to set up the backend environment for the MCS2020 ChatBot project. This setup is essential for developing and testing the server-side components that manage and serve the API endpoints for the chatbot application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the backend repository to your local machine. If you haven't already, you can clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://example.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository/backend
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

## Getting Started 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
